# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Project Overview
I am demonstrating Neural Networks Machine Learning algorithm for this project on credit analysis. Creating a binar classifier in addition to machine learning and neural networks, I will be working on a dataset provided by _Alphabet Soup_, to predict whether applicants will be successful or not. The dataset contains information on more than 34,000 organzations that had received funding.     

## Data Reprocessing
• **What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?**<br/>

The variable that are targeted in this model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column. The target variable is also known as the dependent variable which is used to train our ML model.<br/>

• **What variables(s) are considered to be the features for your model?**<br/>

All columns are considered variables to be features in the model, except target variable in addition to the columns we dropped, "EIN" and "NAME".
