# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Project Overview
I am demonstrating Neural Networks Machine Learning algorithm for this project on credit analysis. Creating a binar classifier in addition to machine learning and neural networks, I will be working on a dataset provided by _Alphabet Soup_, to predict whether applicants will be successful or not. The dataset contaings information on more than 34,000 organzations that had received funding.
